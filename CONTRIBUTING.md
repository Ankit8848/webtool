# Webtool Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Webtool! We welcome contributions from the community to help grow and improve the repository. Please take a moment to review the guidelines below before making a contribution.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the Webtool repository on GitHub.

2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/webtool.git
```
3. Create a new branch for your contribution:
```shell
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
4.  Make sure to follow the naming conventions.

## Issues
[**Issues**](https://github.com/Ankit8848/Webtool/issues/new/choose) are very valuable to this project. Please check if any similar issues are already present. If not, then feel free to open that issue.
  - **Feature 💡 Requests** are a valuable source of contributions others can make.
  - **Bug 🐞 Reports** show where this project is lacking and errors come up.
  - With a **question** you show where contributors can improve the user experience.


 ## Projects
[**Projects**](https://github.com/users/Ankit8848/projects/3) lists the **tasks _completed_, _in progress_ and _the ideas left to be incorporated_ in the project**.
Contributors can work on the **To-Do tasks** by _**creating the issue** (if not present) and **getting yourself assigned**_.
   
5. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message:
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "message"
```

6. Push your branch to your forked repository:
```shell
git push origin your-branch-name
```

7. Open a pull request from your branch to the main Webtool repository.

## Pull Requests
[**Pull requests**](https://github.com/Ankit8848/Webtool/pulls) are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.
Please open an issue at first, describing the changes you want to make and then open a PR (Pull Request) and link it to that issue.

8. Wait for the repository maintainers to review your contribution. They may provide feedback or request changes before merging your pull request.

9. Once your pull request is approved and merged, your code will be added to the Webtool repository!

### Does it state intent ?
You should be _clear_ which problem you're trying to _solve or the feature you want to include_ with your contribution.

For example:

> Added some files

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add files to make the app more user friendly

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.
